A UI and API's based shopping list app.

## Description

The shopping list app is a very simple and intuitive app that lets the user quickly add items to their shopping list and get back lots of relevant information on their products.
This relevant information includes things like caloric value, general price range for the product and an image of the product for better recognizability.
